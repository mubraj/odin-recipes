    <h4>How to Make Chicken Soup</h4>
You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below â€” but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this easy chicken soup:

1. Make the stock by boiling the chicken and veggies until the meat is falling off the bone.
2. Remove the chicken and cut into pieces (discard skin and bones).
3. Strain the vegetables (reserving the stock) and cut into pieces. Rinse the pot.
4. Return everything to the pot. Heat the soup through and season to taste.

<b>Optional:</b> If you want chicken noodle soup, add cooked noodles to the pot just before serving.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken</li>
        <li>4 carrots, halved</li>
        <li>4 stalks celery, halved</li>
        <li>1 large onion, halved</li>
        <li>water to cover</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken, carrots, celery, and onion in a large soup pot; add enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium heat; reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until meat falls off of the bone, about 90 minutes. Skim off foam every so often, as needed.        </li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the pot and let sit until cool enough to handle; chop meat into pieces, and discard skin and bones.</li>
        <li>Strain out vegetables, reserving the stock; rinse the soup pot and return the stock to the pot. Chop vegetables into smaller pieces; return chopped chicken and vegetables to the pot.</li>
        <li>Warm soup until heated through; season with salt, pepper, and chicken bouillon to taste.</li>
    </ol>
