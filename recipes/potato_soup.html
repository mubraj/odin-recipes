    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, diced</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>8 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken stock, or enough to cover potatoes</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried tarragon</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li> 
    </ul>


<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon pieces on paper towels. Drain off all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease.    </li>
    <li>Cook celery and onion in the reserved bacon drippings until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes. Add cubed potatoes, and toss to coat. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to the pan, and add enough chicken stock to just cover the potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro. Bring cream mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add cream mixture to the potato mixture; stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Transfer about 1/2 of the soup to a blender and puree. Return to the Dutch oven. Adjust seasonings to taste.</li>
