## Recipe Webpage 🕸️📃
Made a recipe page to demonstrate fundamental HTML and CSS.   

## Insights 💭
My very first task under the revised Odin Project curriculum was this one. I gained knowledge about how to input headers, paragraphs, photos, and links as well as create directories, files, and links. For my recipes, I was also able to make both ordered and unordered lists. In order to make the code clear and understandable to any viewer, I was able to use user friendly structure and simplicity..
